Google Chrome extension: add numbering to tab titles

![Screenshot](./screenshot.png)

This extension writes the tab number to the first eight tabs, the ones accessible with <kbd>ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>cmd</kbd> + *number*.

## Known issues

- does not add numbers to pinned tabs, internal error pages, "new tab" pages or other special tabs

- does not keep in sync when dragging tabs to/from another window

- will mess up with titles already starting with the characters `ยน`...`โธ`
